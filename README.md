cd ecommerce-store
```

3. Under "Source", select **Deploy from a branch**
4. Choose `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder
5. Click **Save**

Your site will be live at: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/ecommerce-store/`

## 💾 Data Storage

### localStorage Keys:
- `ecommerce_cart` - Stores shopping cart items
- `ecommerce_orders` - Stores order history

### Data persists:
- ✅ Across browser sessions
- ✅ Page refreshes
- ❌ Not across different devices/browsers
- ❌ Cleared when browser data is cleared

## 🧪 Testing the Dummy Payment Gateway

You can use any test credit card information:
- Card Number: `4111 1111 1111 1111` (or any number)
- Name: Any name
- Expiry: Any future date (MM/YY)
- CVV: Any 3 digits

**Note:** This is a demo gateway - no real payment processing occurs.

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding More Products

Edit `script.js` and modify the `PRODUCTS` array:

```javascript
const PRODUCTS = [
    {
        id: 7,  // Unique ID
        name: 'Your Product Name',
        price: 99.99,
        image: 'https://your-image-url.com/image.jpg',
        category: 'Category',
        stock: 10
    },
    // Add more products...
];
```

### Changing Colors

Edit `styles.css` to change the color scheme:
- Primary color: `#2563eb` (blue)
- Success color: `#10b981` (green)
- Danger color: `#ef4444` (red)

### Adding Real Payment Processing

To add real payment processing, you'll need:
1. A backend server (Node.js, Python, etc.)
2. Payment gateway integration (Stripe, PayPal, Square)
3. Secure API endpoints
4. SSL certificate

## 📱 Browser Compatibility

Works on all modern browsers:
- ✅ Chrome/Edge
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Safari
- ✅ Mobile browsers

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Data Privacy**: All data is stored locally in the user's browser
2. **No Backend**: This is a static site - no server required
3. **Demo Only**: The payment gateway is for demonstration purposes
4. **Production Use**: For real e-commerce, you need:
   - Real payment processing
   - User authentication
   - Database storage
   - SSL certificate
   - Backend API

## 🔧 Local Development

To run locally:

1. Open `index.html` in your browser, or
2. Use a local server:

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Node.js (with http-server)
npx http-server

# VS Code Live Server extension
# Right-click index.html → "Open with Live Server"
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`
